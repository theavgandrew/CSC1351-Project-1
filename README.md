# CSC1351-Project-1
The program takes in a user-chosen input and output file. 
It then reads through the input file line-by-line. After that, the program orders the contents in an ordered list and then outputs the contents onto the output file. Right now, it only works for cars. 

Each line of your input file should be of three varieties:
(A, String model, int year, int cost), (D, String model, int year), or (D, int index). 

To run the program, simply type in the file path of your input and output file. After that, check your output file, and viola! Your out-of-order car list in your input file is now in a cleanly-formatted output file.
